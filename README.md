# Hardware Simulator

On this project you will be able to explore electronics and its link with software at the level that best fits you.
From transistors and logic gates to compilers and your own programs.

This is a side projects that links two of my hobbies: programming and electronics. 
I'm still learning about both and I will be updating the project as I do so.
